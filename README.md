# TextFiltering

A simple C++ project to help my brother learn how open source contributions work

### Build
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Run the app
The example app takes input strings as command-line arguments and prints transformed output.
```bash
./build/text_filtering_app "I like to walk outside"
```

### Run tests
```bash
./build/text_filtering_test
```
